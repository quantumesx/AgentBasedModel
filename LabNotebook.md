A thesis project studying the evolution of communication in an evolutionary robotic system.

## Feb. 19, 2019

**Final Product Components:**

1. Introduction:  
  * The emergence of communication
    * research in animals
    * research in humans
    * theories (the importance of environment)
    * the important of modeling
    * general hypothesis and predictions
  * Research in evolutionary robotics
    * what is ER, how to do ER research
    * why use ER for this project
    * specific hypotheses and predictions
  * ...
2. Methods
  * Specific set up for the project
  * rationales for each step
3. Results

* Model:
* LitReview: for article summaries, 1 daily

**To-do list:**

Model:
1. Build simulation that works with multiple agents
2. Simulation with simple evolution (no comm.)
3. Simulation with communication
