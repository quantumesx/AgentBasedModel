# Evolution of Communication

A thesis project studying the evolution of communication in an evolutionary robotic system.

## Feb. 19, 2019

**Final Product Components:**

1. Introduction:  
  * The emergence of communication
    * research in animals
    * research in humans
    * theories (the importance of environment)
    * the important of modeling
    * general hypothesis and predictions
  * Research in evolutionary robotics
    * what is ER, how to do ER research
    * why use ER for this project
    * specific hypotheses and predictions
  * ...
2. Methods
  * Specific set up for the project
  * rationales for each step
3. Results
4. Discussion
5. Model

**Work Flow**
* LabNotebook: update daily
* Model:
* LitReview: for article summaries, 1 daily

**To-do list:**

Model:
1. Build simulation that works with multiple agents
2. Simulation with simple evolution (no comm.)
3. Simulation with communication

**To-do**
1. Lay out steps and parameters for Marocoo & Nolfi, 2007
2. Decide on the structure of the model & what information is needed for each section

## Feb. 21

Today:
- NA

Tomorrow:
- Start coding


## Feb. 22

Today:
- Initial diagrams for modules for the code

Tomorrow:
- Specs for Marocoo & Nolfi, 2007 experiment

## Feb. 23

Today:
- Re-read Marocoo & Nolfi, 2007

Tomorrow:
- Specs for Marocoo & Nolfi, 2007 experiment

## Feb. 24

Today:
- Specs for Marocoo & Nolfi, 2007 experiment
- Figure out how to use matplotlib for animation
- Setup github repo, venv,

Tomorrow:
- Build model with 1 agent
- Generate animation for trial

## Feb. 25
Today:
- Build model with 1 agent

Tomorrow:
- Build model with multiple agents
- generate animation for trials

## Feb. 26

## Mar. 1

## Mar. 2

## Mar. 3
Today:
- write environment class
- write sensor classes
  - IR Sensors
  - Ground Sensors
  - comm. self sensor
  - comm. other sensor
- write actuator classes
  - comm. sensor
  - wheels (simple version)
- Debug angle problem

Tomorrow:
- write controller (with a fixed pre-built network)
- write agent class (assuming a one-agent environment atm)
  - perception
  - computation
  - action
  - updating loc


## Mar. 4
Today:
- completed ang related functions

Tomorrow:
- get 1 agent model to work...mostly, debug still needed

## Mar. 5
Today:
- wrote controller
- wrote agent
- wrote sensors
- prepared for presentation

Tomorrow:
- write trial function animate function

## Mar. 6 - Mar. 11
Midterm & recover from midterm...

## Mar. 12
Today:
- Tested running code in console, but it doesn't work as Python is not installed as a backend. In the future, write functions in python scripts but will run the experiments in jupyter notebook.
- wrote controller class in python script

This is pretty inefficient. I don't technically need to communicate with other people what I'm doing for now. There are better ways to prioritize & build up work flow.

I'm going to ditch this journal, or at least the date part of it. This is painful to read anyway.

Here are the components of the thesis:
- Introduction (longer than normal)
- Methods
- Results
- Discussion
